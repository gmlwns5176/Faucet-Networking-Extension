This is Faucet Networking, a Game Maker extension by Simeon Maxein (MedO) for easy
integration of networking into Game Maker games. It is distributed under the ISC license,
which is short and simple enough that I don't have to explain it, just read the LICENSE
file.

I have worked many days to create this library and support its users. If you want to
support me in return, you can use flattr:

You can find the source code for this project at Github:
https://github.com/Medo42/Faucet-Networking-Extension/


Usage

See help.pdf

Creating the extension from source

To create the .gex extension file, you need the following steps:
- Compile a .dll from the source code in the faucet directory
- Create the .gex from the .dll


Compiling the .dll

For building the .dll I recommend using MinGW, because that's what I use myself
(version 4.5.2). MSVC should work too, but has not been tested.

This project requires some libraries from Boost, available from http://www.boost.org
You need at least Boost 1.47.0 to build this library.

At this time no build script is provided, so start up your favourite IDE and set up
the following rules:
- all .cpp files in the faucet directory and subdirectories should be compiled
  and then linked as a dll.
- As include directories, you need to set up the Boost include dir as well as the project
  directory itself (i.e. the directory containing the "faucet" source directory)
- Link statically with the mswsock and ws2_32 libraries, as well as the boost system library
  and Boost threads. Use the multithreaded static (mt-s) variants for both. Also, statically
  link with the multithreading-safe standard library.
- For compiling with mingw, make sure to add the -mthreads switch to both the compiler and
  the linker. I'm not sure if this is really required, but the documentation says that this
  will make exceptions thread-safe, which sounds like a good thing.
  
Please let me know if it worked, I set this up more or less by trial and error myself :P


Creating the .gex

For this task you need the GM Extension Maker, which you can download from
http://www.yoyogames.com/make/extensions . Open the extension description file (faucetnet.ged)
in the main project directory. You'll have to adapt it to work for you, so click on the 
faucetNetworking.dll file and switch to the "Misc" tab. Change the "Original Name" to
the pathname where your own .dll is located.

Now you should be able to build the extension (File->Build Package...)
